# project12
Computer science project, 12th grade. (Appx. 2 months)

Written in Turbo C++, I envisioned it to be a Facebook-like system, where users connected on LAN could text each other.
A basic chat system could be implemented using public folders of the users, with text files storing the messages.

Messaging functionality on same pc was developed, the latter part (cross PCs) was never though.

Without any structured software design pattern and with the whole code only residing in my mind, the project got out of hand really quickly. 

I used OOPS and procedure oriented paradigm while relying heavily on polymorphism (Example: load() with different messages).
Even ASCII animations have been hardcoded (for loops and stuff).
