Computer science project, 12th grade. (Appx. 2 months)

Written on Turbo C++. Was envisioned to be a messaging system, where users connected on LAN could text each other.
A basic chat system could be implemented using public folders of the users, with messages being stored in text files.

Messaging functionality on same pc was developed, the latter part (cross PCs) was never though.

I used OOPS and other procedure oriented paradigms while relying heavily on polymorphism (Example: load() with different messages).
Even ASCII animations have been hardcoded (for loops and stuff).

### Features
<ul>
  <li>User login</li>
  <li>Admin Panel</li>
  <li>Send messages to participants</li>
  <li>Read your messages</li>
  <li>View your information (Name, username, DOB etc)</li>
</ul>
