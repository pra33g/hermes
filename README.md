# hermes
Computer science project, 12th grade. (Appx. 2 months)

Written in Turbo C++, I envisioned it to be a messaging system, where users connected on LAN could text each other.
A basic chat system could be implemented using public folders of the users, with messages being stored in text files.

Messaging functionality on same pc was developed, the latter part (cross PCs) was never though.

Without any structured software design pattern and with the whole code only residing in my mind, the project got out of hand really quickly. 

I used OOPS and procedure other oriented paradigms while relying heavily on polymorphism (Example: load() with different messages).
Even ASCII animations have been hardcoded (for loops and stuff).

You can run this code (here)[https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler]
